PD: Please, if you're using this scripts, send me an email just to know if
there's anyone outside there. If you find any error, please report it to me
and I'll try to get it fixed, opening a issue request on github helps to track them!

Those scripts are updated when I have the opportunity to deal with the environment, so they maybe outdated until I have the chance to update them to newer versions, and may have errors not detected when performing updates on others, please, test with care and report any issue.

Philosophy is: Release Early, Release Often, so some scripts can be ugly (no error control, etc), but provide the basic functionality, in later updates, they will be improved.
